## 1.9.0

* Remove deprecated functions (`ignoreTag`, `ignoreAllTreesContent`, `takeAllTreesContent`)
* Rename `parseText'` into `parseText`
* `takeContent` and `ignoreContent` now cover entities
* Align behaviour of `take`* and `ignore`* functions

## 1.8.0.1

* Use doctest to validate code examples from documentation

## 1.8.0

* Upgrade to conduit 1.3.0

## 1.7.1

* Add `psDecodeIllegalCharacters` field in `ParseSettings` to specify how illegal characters references should be decoded
* Fix compatibility with GHC 8.4.1 [#121](https://github.com/snoyberg/xml/issues/121)

## 1.7.0

* `psDecodeEntities` is no longer passed numeric character references (e.g., `&#x20;`, `&#65;`) and the predefined XML entities (`&amp;`, `&lt;`, etc). They are now handled by the parser. Both of these construct classes only have one spec-compliant interpretation and this behaviour must always be present, so it makes no sense to force user code to re-implement the parsing logic.
* In prior versions of xml-conduit, hexadecimal character references with a leading `0x` or `0X` like `&0x20;` were accepted. This was not in compliance with the XML specification and it has been corrected.
* xml-conduit now rejects some (but not all) invalid-according-to-spec entities during parsing: specifically, entities with a leading `#` that are not character references are no longer allowed and will be parse errors.

## 1.6.0

* Dropped the dependency on `data-default` for `data-default-class`, reducing the transitive dependency load. For most users, this will not be a breaking change, but it does mean that importing `Text.XML.Conduit` will no longer bring various instances for `Default` into scope. This will break code that relies on those instances and does not otherwise see them. To fix this, import `Data.Default` from `data-default` or one of the more specific instance-providing packages directly (e.g., `data-default-dlist` for the `DList` instance).

## 1.5.1

* New render setting, `rsXMLDeclaration`; setting it to `False` omits the XML declaration.

## 1.5.0

* `tag` function no longer throws an exception when attributes don't match [#93](https://github.com/snoyberg/xml/pull/93)
* Add `many_` combinator to avoid building results in memory [#94](https://github.com/snoyberg/xml/pull/94)
* Turn some functions from `Consumer Event m a` to `ConduitM Event o m a` to allow yielding values
* Replace `takeAllTreesContent` with `takeAnyTreeContent`, that only consumes one tree
* Introduce `NameMatcher` type to refactor tag parsers
* Add a couple of `take*` functions to stream events rather than parse them
* Rename `ignore*` functions to comply with naming convention

## 1.4.0.3

## 1.4.0.2

* Parse XML encoding case-insensitively
* Remove extra EOL when printing XmlException

## 1.4.0.1

* Handle CDATA in takeAllTreesContent [#88](https://github.com/snoyberg/xml/pull/88)

## 1.3.3.1

* Generalize signature of choose (Fixes [#72](https://github.com/snoyberg/xml/issues/72)) [#73](https://github.com/snoyberg/xml/pull/73)

## 1.3.3

* Escaping CDATA closing tag in CDATA [#69](https://github.com/snoyberg/xml/pull/69)

## 1.3.2

* Support for iso-8859-1 [#63](https://github.com/snoyberg/xml/issues/63)
